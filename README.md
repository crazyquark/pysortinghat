============

The Sorting Hat: a small python script for organizing your movies library. No GUI right now.
Originally on github.com.  

For the record, only movie processing works now, the rest is WIP(TV shows for example)

Requirements
------------
Python and:  
- termcolor package  
- rarfile package which also needs libunrar for all platforms  
- see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rarfile/2.2  
- You will probably need to build from source, see ftp://ftp.rarlabs.com/rar/  
-----
- Check out the script deps/makedeps.sh for an automated way to install dependencies(OS X and Linux only)
